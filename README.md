# neural-network-from-scratch
this is going to go badly isn't it lol

I am learning everything off of this book: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html
it is amazing

I am trying to write a basic neural network like how the book describes
so it's probably not going to be written the best lol

totally did not steal the mnist loader and files from the link above


some good resources:
